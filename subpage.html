<h1>1-Getting More Organized</h1>
    <p>A majority of people with ADHD have a hard time with organizational skills. A daily organizer or planner can help you become better organized. It is essential because it will help you map out your day, penning down everything you need to do in a day. Daily planners are also excellent tools that help with time management problems. Working with set routines can also make a significant difference in how you cope with everyday life. To become more organized, you also need to eliminate or decrease distractions. Set up your work or living environment in a way that there are minimal distractions. White noise machines or noise-cancelling headphones can be helpful.</p><br>
<h1>2- Work on Social Skills</h1>
    <p>Working on relationships is instrumental for anyone battling symptoms of adhd . Spending quality time with family and friends is useful. Listen vigilantly to conversations without always cutting people off. Most importantly, develop relationships with individuals who understand and sympathize with your struggles with the neurodevelopmental disorder.Social skills training can help grown-ups relate better with relatives, friends, and colleagues. People with families can also benefit from family therapy or marital counselling to improve family function and relationships.</p>
<h1>5- Take Care of your Health</h1>
    <p>Participate in activities that help you blow off steam like dancing, exercising, or sports. Good nutrition is non-negotiable for persons with ADHD. Focus on meals with healthy foods and limit sugary and processed foods. It’s also crucial to get quality sleep every night. To reduce stress in your life, experiment with various relaxation techniques like listening to music or reading a book. Reward yourself when things go well, and remember not to be too hard on yourself when things do not go too well. </p>

    <p>ADHD symptoms can affect each child differently, depending on a number of things not limited to but including age, gender, and type of ADHD.</p>
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Symptoms of ADHD—not paying attention, being in constant motion, and doing things before thinking—are easy to confuse with how young children often behave.</li><br>
            <li>If you think your kid may be showing childhood ADHD symptoms, it's important to speak with their doctor or mental health specialist right away.</li><br>
            <li>Some kids will outgrow their ADHD, but for others, their ADHD symptoms can last into young adulthood and even beyond.</li><br>
