        <h2>What Is ADHD?</h2>
        <p>ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It’s a brain disorder that affects how you pay attention, sit   still, and control your behavior. It happens in children and teens and can continue into adulthood.<br>ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder in children. Boys are more likely to have it than girls. It’s usually spotted during the early school years, when a child begins to have problems paying attention.<br>ADHD can't be prevented or cured. But spotting it early, plus having a good treatment and education plan, canhelp a child or adult with ADHD manage their symptoms.
        </p>
        <h2>ADHD Types</h2>
        <p>Symptoms are grouped into three types:</p>

        <h2>ADHD vs. ADD</h2>
        <p>Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is the old name for ADHD. It was officially changed in the 1990s. Some people still use both names to talk about this one condition.</p>
        <h2>ADHD Causes</h2>
        <p>Experts aren’t sure what causes ADHD. Several things may lead to it, including:</p>
        <p>
            <li>Genes. ADHD tends to run in families.</li>
            <li>Brain chemicals. These may be out of balance in people with ADHD.</li>
            <li>Brain changes. Areas of the brain that control attention are less active in children with ADHD.</li>
        </p>
        <p>Sugar doesn’t cause ADHD. ADHD also isn’t caused by too much TV, a stressful home life, poor schools, or food allergies.</p>
        <h2>ADHD Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Studies have found that a number of risk factors may play a role in the development of ADHD. Some of them affect a baby’s brain development during pregnancy:</p>
        <p>
            <li>Poor nutrition</li>
            <li>Infections</li>
            <li>Smoking</li>
            <li>Drinking</li>
            <li>Substance abuse</li>
        </p>
        <p>Other things may affect a child's brain development after birth. Some of the things researchers have looked at include:</p>
        <p>
            <li>Being born prematurely</li>
            <li>Toxins, such as lead</li>
            <li>A brain injury or a brain disorder. Damage to the front of the brain, called the frontal lobe, can cause problems controlling impulses and emotions.</li>
            <li>“Western” diet. One study found that children who ate a diet high in added sugar, fats, and sodium and low in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids had a greater chance of ADHD.</li>
            <li>Nutritional deficiencies</li>
            <li>Food additives. There may be a link between food coloring additives and preservatives and ADHD, but this may only be for children who are already at a high level of risk for the condition.</li>
            <li>Family income. Children from low-income families or families that have a drop in income have a greater chance of having ADHD.</li>
        </p>
        <h2>ADHD Diagnosis and Testing</h2>
        <p>It can be hard to diagnose ADHD, especially in children. No one test will spot it. Doctors diagnose ADHD in children and teens after discussing symptoms at length with the child, parents, and teachers and then observing the child's behaviors.</p>
        <p>Doctors use the American Psychiatric Association’s guidelines, which are based on how many symptoms a person has and how long they’ve had them. They’ll also rule out other things that may be causing the symptoms, such as health conditions or problems in daily life.</p>
        <p>To confirm a diagnosis of ADHD or learning differences, a child may take a series of tests to check their neurological and psychological status. The tests should be given by a pediatrician or mental health professional with experience in diagnosing and treating ADHD. Your primary care doctor might refer you to a specialist such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. The tests may include:</p>
        <p>
            <li>A medical and social history of both the child and the family.</li>
            <li>A physical exam and neurological assessment that includes screenings of vision, hearing, and verbal and motor skills. More tests may be given if hyperactivity may be related to another physical problem.</li>
            <li>An evaluation of intelligence, aptitude, personality traits, or processing skills. These are often done with input from the parents and teachers if the child is of school age.</li>
            <li>A scan called the Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA) System, which measures theta and beta brain waves. The theta/beta ratio has been shown to be higher in children and adolescents with ADHD than in children without it.</li>
        </p>
        <p>Several studies have compared ADHD in children of different racial and ethnic groups and found that Black, Hispanic, and Asian children are much less likely than white children to be diagnosed with the disorder.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons for this. Many of these children may not have access to the care they need because of income or racial discrimination. If you fear discrimination or negative treatment, you may be less likely to talk to a health care professional about your child’s symptoms. Cultural and family values may also play a part in how adults respond to their children’s symptoms and whether or not they opt to seek treatment.</p>
        <p>We need more research to better understand all the issues behind these disparities. If you have questions about your child’s symptoms, it may help to learn more about them and what may be causing them. From there, you can plan your next steps. </p>
